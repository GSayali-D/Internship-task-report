Vulnerability: SMBv1 Protocol Detection
Host: 10.0.0.5
Port: 445/tcp
Severity: ðŸ”´ Critical
CVE: CVE-2017-0144
Plugin ID: 100000
Description:
The target host supports the obsolete and insecure SMBv1 protocol, which is vulnerable to multiple remote code execution exploits including EternalBlue.
Risk Impact: Unauthorized attackers can exploit this to gain full control.
Remediation: Disable SMBv1 via system configuration. Apply Microsoft patch KB4012598.
